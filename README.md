## 🎯 Game Mechanics

### 💎 Starting Resources
Each player begins with:
- **1000 Tokens** (currency for trading)
- **0 old** (high-value, stable resource)
- **0 Water** (utility resource, moderate volatility)
- **0 Oil** (high-risk, high-reward resource)

### Trading Actions

| Action | Description | Strategic Use | Market Impact |
|--------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| **🛒 Buy** | Purchase resources at current market price | Accumulate before price increases | Increases demand, drives up prices in next round |
| **💸 Sell** | Convert resources to tokens | Lock in profits, free up capital | Increases supply, lowers prices in next round |
| **🔥 Burn** | Destroy resources permanently | Reduce supply to increase future prices | Decreases total supply, raises prices in next round |
| **⚔️ Sabotage** | Target opponent resources | Disrupt competitor strategies | Affects opponent's ability to influence market |

### 📊 Market Dynamics
- **Player Action Impact**: Resource prices adjust based on collective player behavior from previous rounds
- **Supply & Demand**: Buy actions increase demand, sell actions increase supply, burn actions reduce supply
- **Round-to-Round Changes**: Each new round reflects market changes from all previous player actions
- **Price Volatility**: Each resource responds differently to player trading patterns
- **Strategic Timing**: Understanding how past actions affect future prices is key to success

### 🏆 Winner-Takes-All Victory
At the end of 20 rounds, the game automatically:
1. **Auto-Sell All Assets**: Smart contract liquidates all player resources
2. **Calculate Final Values**: Token totals determine the winner
3. **Transfer Prize Pool**: Winner receives all tokens from the collective pool
4. **On-Chain Verification**: Victory and rewards permanently recorded on Starknet

**Prize Mechanics**:
- All player entry fees and traded tokens form the prize pool
- Winner gets 100% of the total token pool
- Transactions are final and verifiable on blockchain
